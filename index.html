         Mass incarceration is intertwined with some of the United States’ most persistent social challenges - racial inequality, residential segregation, housing instability, unequal access to education and healthcare, and gun violence. Yet policy conversations often treat crime as an individual outcome rather than a structural one. When people are removed from their families and communities, the consequences extend far beyond prison walls - relationships are strained, economic mobility is disrupted, and the conditions that produced vulnerability to crime in the first place are often reinforced. Without interventions that support family stability, this cycle persists.

        Once a week, I facilitate a parenting program inside Cook County Jail at 3015 S. California Blvd.
        The individuals I work with consistently express a strong desire to be present for their children,
        even while navigating the constraints of incarceration.

        Over time, however, I began to notice recurring gaps between the program’s intentions and its
        practical impact. This prompted a broader question — what would it take to design interventions
        that function more effectively under carceral constraints?

    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p class="section__lede">
      In Jail, communication with family is a scarce resource and privilege — expensive, time-limited, and fragile.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-2">

        <h3>Notes from inside Jail</h3>

        <p>
          During sessions, broad conversations about parenting and caregiving often drift into lived experience — conflict with partners,
          questions of authority in the family, feeling excluded from family decisions, loss of control, domestic fights that lead to
          children being cut off, alongside the fear that kids will move on without them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both cohorts are predominantly Black (14/15), and participants often raise differences in cultural practices and expectations around
          child-rearing. Although our curriculum is evidence-based, it has pushed me to think more critically about what “normative” good
          parenting practices are. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet the biggest constraint is structural: inside jail, sustained contact is hard, so skills rarely get practiced enough to stick.

        <h3>Research on the Efficacy of Parenting Programs</h3>

        <p>
          Troy et al. (2018) note that while prison-based parenting programs are often viewed as meaningful and can improve parents’
          confidence and skills, the evidence on long-term effectiveness is limited and mixed, with few studies including sustained
          follow-up to assess whether initial benefits persist over time.
