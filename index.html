        <h1>Designing systems that sustain family connection during incarceration</h1>

        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Communication within families is often framed as a private matter — something shaped by personality, culture, or individual effort.
            But when communication is systematically constrained for a large and identifiable population, it becomes a social issue.
            The quality of family connection influences how public resources are allocated, how parenting is evaluated and racialized within institutional settings,
            and how successfully individuals reintegrate after incarceration. Stronger family relationships are associated with lower recidivism, which carries
            implications not only for household stability but for public safety and long-term fiscal priorities. What may appear interpersonal is therefore deeply structural:
            the conditions under which families are able to stay connected shape broader social and policy outcomes.

          <strong>Motivation:</strong> Once a week, I go into Cook County Jail at 3015 S. California Blvd. to facilitate a parenting program.
          Most of the Individuals in Custody (IIC's) I work with are motivated and eager to learn how to be better parents, siblings, and caregivers
          despite the constraints they live under. However, over the last four months, I’ve begun to notice recurring breakdowns in how communication
          with family members actually functions. This prototype emerges from those observations and is intended as a response to those gaps.
          In jail, phone calls are short and expensive, and often meander aimlessly. Visits are logistically difficult, families are frequently turned away at the gate,
          and the opportunity cost of showing up continues to rise. When misunderstandings occur, there is rarely enough time to repair them.
          Instead, they linger — sometimes until the next brief and uncertain chance to connect.

            <strong>So what?</strong> If relationships are built through repetition, then rationing contact limits the possibility of relational change —
            even when people are motivated.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p class="section__lede">
          Correctional systems often describe family connection as predictive of safer reentry, but operationally,
          communication is treated like a scarce privilege — expensive, time-limited, and fragile.

            <p>
              Sessions rarely stay only about “parenting tips.” They drift into the real stuff: conflict with partners, authority,
              feeling excluded from family decisions, and the fear that kids will move on without them.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the biggest constraint isn’t lack of care. It’s that sustained contact is structurally hard — so the skills never get
              repeated enough to stick.
