        Designing systems that sustain family connection during incarceration

        <p>
         Mass incarceration is intertwined with some of the United States’ most persistent social challenges - racial inequality, residential segregation, housing instability, unequal access to education and healthcare, and gun violence. Yet policy conversations often treat crime as an individual outcome rather than a structural one. When people are removed from their families and communities, the consequences extend far beyond prison walls - relationships are strained, economic mobility is disrupted, and the conditions that produced vulnerability to crime in the first place are often reinforced. Without interventions that support family stability, this cycle persists.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p class="motivation-text">
        Once a week, I facilitate a parenting program inside Cook County Jail at 3015 S. California Blvd.
        The individuals I work with consistently express a strong desire to be present for their children,
        even while navigating the constraints of incarceration.

        Over time, however, I began to notice recurring gaps between the program’s intentions and its
        practical impact. This prompted a broader question — what would it take to design interventions
        that function more effectively under carceral constraints?

    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p class="section__lede">
      In carceral institutions in the U.S., communication with family is a scarce resource and a rare privilege — expensive and fragile.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-2">
      <!-- Card 1 -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Notes from inside Jail</h3>

        <p>
          During sessions, broad conversations about parenting and caregiving drift into lived experience — conflict with partners, uncertainty about authority at home, feeling excluded from family decisions, and the fear that children will grow up emotionally distant.Several fathers spoke about arguments that led caregivers to stop answering the phone, sometimes for weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both cohorts are predominantly Black (14/15), and participants often raise differences in cultural practices and expectations around
          child-rearing. Although our curriculum is evidence-based, it has pushed me to think more critically about what “normative” good
          parenting practices are. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet the biggest constraint is structural: inside jail, sustained contact is hard, so learned skills rarely get practiced enough to stick.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Card 2 -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Research on Relationships and Recidivism</h3>

        <p>
        Research on recidivism consistently finds that individuals who maintain strong family connections during incarceration are significantly less likely to return to prison (Bales & Mears, 2008; Mears et al., 2012). Visitation, phone contact, and other forms of sustained communication are associated with improved post-release outcomes, suggesting that relationships function as a stabilizing force during reentry.
        </p>

        <div class="mini-quote">
          <p>If relationships are built through repetition, then restricting contact does more than separate families — it quietly undermines one of the strongest protective factors against recidivism.</p>

            This does not necessarily require new hardware. Many carceral facilities already use secure tablets for messaging,
            account access, and approved content. Primary work will go into building the application.
