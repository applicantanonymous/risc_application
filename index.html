              When an individual is incarcerated, a sustained family connection becomes expensive,
              fragile, and hard to repair after conflict. That breakdown does more than just strain relationships during incarceration; it destabilizes caregiving,
              harms children’s emotional security, and leaves people returning home with fewer stabilizing ties.

              This project focuses on incarcerated parents/caregivers and their family members on the outside. Through this proposed product, I hope to support the many children whose parents are incarcerated, reduce recidivism, and make familial connections stronger through reentry, without policing each family's unique culture.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p class="motivation-text">
          Once a week, I facilitate a parenting program inside Cook County Jail at 3015 S. California Blvd.
          The people I work with speak fondly of their children and consistently express a strong desire to be good parents, all while navigating the
          constraints of incarceration.
        </p>

        <p class="motivation-text" style="margin-top:1rem;">
          However, over time, I've noticed the same frictions coming up again and again. To name a few - co-parenting conflict that escalates without repair,
          calls that become the only touchpoint and then break after one argument, distrust of a program language that feels culturally agnostic,
          and (most structurally) how hard it is to practice any skills consistently when contact with anyone from the outside is scarce.
        </p>

        <p class="motivation-text" style="margin-top:1rem;">
          This motivated me to think about what it takes to design a parenting intervention that actually works under carceral constraints. 
          Where communication and access are limited, emotional bandwidth is low, and stress is ever-prevalent. 
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p class="section__lede">
          In most U.S. carceral institutions, family communication is treated like a scarce privilege. It is expensive, vaguely scheduled,
          and easy to lose after conflict.
        </p>

        <div class="grid-2">
          <!-- Card 1 -->
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Notes from inside jail</h3>

            <p>
              In sessions, conversations about parenting quickly become conversations about relationships: conflict with partners, uncertainty
              about authority at home, feeling excluded from family decisions, and fear that children will grow emotionally distant.
              Several fathers described arguments that led caregivers to stop answering the phone — sometimes for weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Participants often raise differences in cultural practices and expectations around child-rearing. Even when a curriculum is
              evidence-based, “good parenting” can be communicated in a way that feels normative — meaning it assumes one culturally specific
              “right” way to parent. This often causes the 28/35 black participants to undermine the curriculum. 
            </p>

            <p>
              But the biggest constraint is structural: relationships are built through repetition, and inside jail sustained contact is hard.
              So even when people learn something useful, it’s difficult to practice it enough for it to stick.
            </p>

            <h3>Research on relationships and recidivism</h3>

            <p>
              Research on recidivism consistently finds that people who maintain strong family connections during incarceration are less likely
              to return to prison (Bales &amp; Mears, 2008; Mears et al., 2012). Visitation, phone contact, and other sustained communication are
              associated with improved post-release outcomes, suggesting that relationships function as a stabilizing force during reentry.
            </p>

            <p>
Relationships are built through repetition. When contact is restricted, it sets off downstream effects that show up in families long after incarceration ends.

            <h3>How engagement is designed</h3>
            <p>
              Engagement formats are built for constrained environments: short calls, limited emotional bandwidth, and asynchronous communication.
              They target specific frictions that repeatedly show up in incarceration-affected families: repair after conflict, co-parenting alignment,
              emotional regulation, and maintaining routines with kids.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
              Development is co-designed with practitioners (family therapists, reentry staff, program facilitators) and people with lived experience,
              so the tools don’t assume one “right” cultural model of parenting.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>What credits unlock</h3>
            <p>
              Credits unlock expanded connection options — for example, more flexibility in timing and format (minutes, messaging windows, video time),
              and lower-friction ways to stay in touch.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
              Rewards expand access; they do not require disclosure of relationship content. The logic stays transparent and predictable.

        </div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-top:1.25rem;">
          <h3>Feasibility</h3>
          <p>
            This does not necessarily require new hardware. Many facilities already use secure tablets for messaging, account access,
            and approved content. The primary build is the application layer: credit logic, activity library, and a simple interface
            that works under real constraints.
