      <section class="section" id="story">
        <h2>Story: Teaching Parenting Without the Conditions to Practice It</h2>

        <p>
          I volunteer with a parenting program inside a county jail. When I began facilitating sessions, I expected our
          conversations to focus on communication skills, emotional regulation, and co-parenting strategies. Instead,
          discussions often shifted toward relationships — conflict with partners, disagreements over decision-making,
          and the difficulty of maintaining a parental role while physically absent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Communication itself was a recurring challenge. Phone calls are short and expensive. Visits are difficult to
          coordinate. Messages do not always arrive when intended. Small misunderstandings can escalate simply because
          there are few opportunities to resolve them.
        </p>

        <p>
          What stood out was that the issue rarely appeared to be a lack of care for their children. Participants were
          engaged and often thoughtful. The larger constraint seemed structural: we were teaching relational skills in an
          environment where meaningful relational contact is inherently limited.
        </p>

        <h3>When parenting tools meet lived experience</h3>
        <p>
          Some participants were hesitant about the parenting strategies we discussed. This was less resistance than
          skepticism. Several felt they already knew how to parent based on how they themselves were raised, while others
          viewed certain recommendations — such as avoiding physical discipline — as inconsistent with their cultural norms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Changing practices that are closely tied to one’s upbringing likely requires more than brief exposure to new
          frameworks. It requires repetition, opportunities to try a different approach, and enough autonomy for the change
          to feel self-directed. An eight-hour program can introduce ideas. It is unlikely to reshape long-standing behavioral
          patterns on its own.
        </p>

        <h3>Parenting, authority, and identity</h3>
        <p>
          Many conversations also reflected broader expectations around fatherhood. Being a parent was frequently described
          in terms of providing, protecting, and maintaining respect within the household — roles that incarceration disrupts
          simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some participants worried their children would grow distant. Others described feeling excluded from everyday family
          decisions. These concerns shaped how they interpreted topics such as shared authority and co-parenting. Over time,
          it became difficult to treat these dynamics as individual attitudes. They appeared more closely tied to widely held
          social expectations — expectations that do not disappear simply because someone is incarcerated.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>

        <p>
          Relationships develop through repeated interaction — everyday conversations, small disagreements, moments of repair.
          When those interactions become scarce, distance tends to grow regardless of intention.
        </p>

        <p>
          Correctional systems often identify family connection as an important predictor of successful reentry. Yet many
          operational policies limit communication rather than supporting it.

          I want to ground this in geography. Jails are not abstract — they’re local, and they vary enormously by county.
          A county-level map makes it easier to see where incarceration is concentrated and, by extension, where family
          relationships are being strained at scale.

        <h2>Solution: A Relational Credit Economy</h2>

        <p>
          If institutional structure shapes what kinds of relationships are possible, then improving outcomes may require more
          than expanding programming. It may require redesigning the conditions under which relationships are maintained.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than treating communication as a scarce privilege, this proposal treats family connection as stabilizing
          infrastructure: access expands in response to sustained relational effort. The point is not to prescribe what “good
          parenting” looks like, but to create conditions where connection remains possible.

        <h3>Feasibility</h3>
        <p>
          This does not necessarily require new hardware. Many facilities already use secure tablets for messaging,
          account access, and approved content. A structured engagement module could run as an additional application
          on an existing system. The main shift is policy: treating communication as something to deliberately support,
          not simply ration.
