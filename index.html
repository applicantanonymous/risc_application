        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p class="motivation-text">
          Once a week, I facilitate a parenting program inside Cook County Jail at 3015 S. California Blvd. The people I work with talk about their children with real care and a steady desire to show up as parents.
        </p>

        <p class="motivation-text" style="margin-top:1rem;">
          Over time, the same barriers come up in different forms. Conflict with a co-parent escalates without any path to repair. One argument can end the only consistent point of contact. Program language can feel disconnected from how families describe parenting in their own communities.
        </p>

        <p class="motivation-text" style="margin-top:1rem;">
          Consequently, I began thinking about program design. What would increased support look like to match the constraints people face while incarcerated?

        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p class="section__lede">
          In many U.S. facilities, family communication functions as a restricted privilege. It is expensive, poorly timed, and easy to lose after conflict.
        </p>

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Notes from inside jail</h3>

            <p>
              In sessions, parenting discussions often shift toward relationship strain. People describe trouble with their ex-partners, uncertainty about their role at home, and worry that their children will pull away. Several fathers described arguments that led fellow-caregivers to stop answering calls for weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Participants also raise differences in parenting expectations and cultural practice. Even when a curriculum is evidence based, particpants percieved it as a normative standard that didn't apply to their specific cultural context.
            </p>

            <p>
              The biggest issue still remained communication. Learned skills are hard to use when contact is limited and unpredictable.
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout--indigo" style="margin-top:1rem;">
              <p style="margin:0;">
                <strong>Takeaway:</strong> fragile contact weakens the family system and leaves less stability to build on after release.
              </p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Research on relationships and recidivism</h3>

            <p>
              Research on recidivism finds lower return to prison among people who maintain family ties during incarceration (Bales &amp; Mears, 2008; Mears et al., 2012). Visitation and other sustained contact are associated with better post release outcomes.
            </p>

            <p>
              When connection breaks down, the effects compound over time. Caregivers take on more alone, conflict persists without repair, and people return home with weaker ties.
            </p>

            <div class="callout callout--indigo" style="margin-top:1rem;">
              <p style="margin:0;">
                <strong>Takeaway:</strong> stable connection supports reentry outcomes and reduces the costs of instability for families. Eventually, downstream effects include a reduction in crime.

        <h2>The Proposed Solution</h2>

        <p class="section__lede">
          A system that rewards voluntary engagement with more options for contact.
        </p>

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>How engagement is designed</h3>
            <p>
              Activities are built for constrained environments and limited attention. They focus on repair after conflict, co-parenting alignment, and routines with children in ways that can fit into short windows of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The activity library is developed with practitioners and people with lived experience. This helps avoid a single cultural model of parenting being treated as the default.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>What credits unlock</h3>
            <p>
              Credits unlock additional connection options such as more flexible visitation timing, or additional call minutes.
            </p>
            <p">
              The system does not require disclosure of participant content and it does not score families on compliance.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-top:1.25rem;">
          <h3>Feasibility</h3>
          <p>
            This does not require new hardware in many settings. Facilities already use secure tablets for messaging and approved content. The primary build is an application layer that manages the program logic, a structured activity library, and an interface that works under operational constraints.
